# Decoding-LEL-A-Blueprint-for-Future-Investment-Decisions

Note: A number of the files mentioned in the README are not included or have been redacted to ensure LEL's private information stays private.
This project was initiated by Akshay Shivdasani, a LEL Venture Fellow, in the summer of 2023. I envision this script as the inception of a project aimed at enabling Lair East Labs to streamline the pitching process using Machine Learning and to evaluate previous investment decisions to provide guidance for future Venture Fellows.
